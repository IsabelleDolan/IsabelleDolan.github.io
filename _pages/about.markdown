Hi, I'm Isabelle Dolan. Currently contributing to Formlabs' 3D printer R&D as a Print Process Engineer, I have expertise in SLA 3D-printing process tuning, Python automated testing, and developing tools for performance analysis.

While completing a bachelors degree in physics and math from Mount Allison University in Canada, I conducted experimental subatomic particle physics research with the A2 Collaboration at the Mainz Microtron in Germany. The culmination of this research is presented in my [honours thesis project](/projects/thesis/).
